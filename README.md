# Viber for Ubuntu 18.04

If you would like to use Viber on your Ubuntu 18.04+ you probably have some difficulties relating libcurl during installation. I asked Viber via their Facebook page but no current plans for fixing this package.

So I downloaded Viber installer deb package for Debian/Ubuntu from viber.com in November 2018. Replaced libcurl3 to libcurl4 in its config file. That's it. It is working fine on Ubuntu 18.04. You can download it from here:
